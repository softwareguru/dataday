I am originally from Mexico City. I currently work as a lead engineer at a non-profit in San Francisco called One Degree which provides a platform for low income families to easily access social services. I have a great passion for data engineering and bring these skills to my current job. On the side, I have created a data engineering community where we spread the word about data engineering in Latin America.
