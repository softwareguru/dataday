In my role as a private consultant, I oversee a dynamic team of seven skilled engineers at an agro-industrial firm. Our primary mission is to develop and deploy cutting-edge machine learning software to efficiently classify fresh produce within automated packing facilities on a global scale. The base code and early versions for such a project were designed and implemented by myself. Concurrently, I hold the esteemed position of Research Professor at Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexicoâ€™s premier private university. Here, I teach science and engineering courses while also guiding the research endeavors of two doctoral candidates.
