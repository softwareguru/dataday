Iâ€™m a IT Solutions Analyst at Applied Materials, working on developing innovative Dot Net applications for iOMS Team.

On research front, I have worked on identifying COVID-19 patterns on human Chest X-Ray and Detection as a real time service to doctors and radiologists in collaboration with Niramai Health Analytics, and other 250 doctors and radiologists across Karnataka State; under the guidance of Prof. &amp; Chair of CSA Chiranjeeb Bhattacharya, ML Labs, Indian Institute of Science.

Previously, I did my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from JSS Science and Technology University, Mysore. Here, I did my Project with Prof. M P Pushpalata and in collaboration with Pathology Department, JSS Hospitals, Mysore on Classification and Localisation on Non Small Cell Lung Cancer.

I am excited about research problems involving the design of efficient architectures for solving various Computer Vision problems such as detection/segmentation/classification. I am also interested in changing clinical practice using CV and NLP algorithms.
