My name is Victoriya Kalmanovich , and I am an R&amp;D group lead at a large corporation in Israel. I specialize in healing failing work environments, by addressing them as failing startup companies. I promote and lead innovative and broad processes throughout the organization.

In my day-to-day experience, I deal with all technological issues, product management, budgets and client handling.

I am an education enthusiast, and often use educational directives as a part of my management strategies. I am a firm believer of deploying data science in every possible project. I have organized a successful data science hackathon and am now working on forming a data science community within the organization. I love writing and lecturing on management, leadership and workplace challenges.
