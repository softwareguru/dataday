Istio and Envoy are foundational building blocks of the Salesforce Service Mesh. This presentation walks you through our service mesh journey. I will briefly talk about why we chose the service mesh design pattern, how we initially built it using envoy and our in-house control plane and our subsequent pivot to Istio. I will discuss how we are currently leveraging Istio and our plan to increase adoption of Istio to further enhance our Service Mesh platform.
