In this workshop, attendees will get an introduction to Dask, a framework for distributed computing in Python. After this overview, attendees will get hands-on experience configuring a Dask cluster, creating distributed datasets with Dask collections, and performing distributed training evaluation of LightGBM models. The workshop will cover related topics along the way, including how to optimize Dask cluster settings for machine learning training, how to diagnose issues that arise during training, and how to choose good ranges for key hyperparameters.
