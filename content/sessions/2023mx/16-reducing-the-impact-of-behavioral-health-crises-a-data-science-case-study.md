How can we leverage data to reduce the impact of suicide, overdose, and other behavioral health crises? At Carnegie Mellon University´s Data Science for Social Good, we partnered with two counties in Kansas to build a predictive machine learning model that identifies individuals at high risk. We brought together data from a range of sources, including ambulances, hospitals, mental health centers, and the criminal justice system, and developed an end-to-end pipeline that informs proactive and preventative interventions to improve health outcomes. This talk will discuss the technical aspects of the tool, evaluation process, key challenges, and ethical considerations.
