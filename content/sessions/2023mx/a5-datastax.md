In 2022, global digital sales channels eclipsed $5.7 trillion (USD). However, having a robust website or mobile app was not enough to keep customers from shopping with competitors. One of the deciding factors is ensuring that web pages and mobile apps load quickly. Co-locating an application with its data provides a significant advantage over the competition. DataStax's Astra platform (built on open source technology like Apache Cassandra and Apache Pulsar), can solve data distribution problems through horizontal scaling and data center awareness. Join us and learn ways to serve data to your customers, no matter where they are.
