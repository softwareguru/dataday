This talk is going to be a walkthrough of the ongoing data analysis done for the MIT REAP, Focus Mexico City, a dynamic global initiative that engages with communities around the world to strengthen innovation-driven entrepreneurial ecosystems and transform economies. 

In particular, we'll focus on 3 main elements: 1) the construction of a National Innovation Capacity Index through the p2distance measurement, and its relationship with economic complexity; 2) a quantitative approach to the measurement of entrepreneurial quality; and 3) the preliminary insights from where a group of key stakeholders from government, venture capital, corporate, academia and entrepreneurs are working to boost Innovation Driven Entrepreneurship in Mexico City.
