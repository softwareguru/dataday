This talk will walk through canary deployments process and how to achieve the same using Kubernetes service orchestration or Spring Cloud Gateway focusing on the limitations of these approaches and how Istio overcomes these limitations.
Spring cloud Gateway or Kubernetes LoadBalancer service or Ingress controllers only supports the edge service routing and not Internal routing from edge service to another service in cluster.
This is where Istio virtual services and destination rules come to rescue â€“ this talk with elaborate further on how Istio provides an optimal solution for canary releases in this scenario.
