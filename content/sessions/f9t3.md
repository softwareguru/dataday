One of our main goals in GoPay is to automate mutual TLS communication between GoPay and our partner. We will share how we decide to use and manage Istio, change the configuration to suit our mTLS use cases, how we adapt Istio changes related to mutual TLS, and how our central certificate is managed, and how to set up automatic mutual TLS communication with Istio Egress TLS origination and Istio Gateway.
