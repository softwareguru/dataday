Istio is the most popular Service Mesh. But API Gateways are also very important components in the Cloud Native mix. But if you go for a completely separate tool for API Gateway requirements and for other stuff use Istio, then you effectively have to maintain two different tool and build the expertise in your team for two different disciplines.
