The prevalence of decision-making mechanisms in life-impacting decisions, ranging from bank loans and college admissions to probation decisions, makes understanding and controlling the fairness of algorithmically-generated decisions indispensable. This talk will give an introduction to algorithmic fairness, focusing on classification tasks. A look at state-of-the-art fairness-correcting methods will be presented, emphasising data preprocessing solutions.
