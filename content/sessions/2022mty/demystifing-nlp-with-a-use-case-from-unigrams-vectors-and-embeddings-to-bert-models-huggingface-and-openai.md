Ángel will walk you through a step-by-step process of how to understand NLP; this is a gentle introduction to concepts like unigrams, vectors and embeddings. Then we deep dive into how to use these concepts with platforms HuggingFace (i.e. BERT models) and OpenAI, by the end of the talk you will feel confident on how to use some HuggingFace models and understand OpenAI’s API basics.
 
This talk is broken into two main categories:

NLP basics

     Big picture- where in AI NLP sits
     unigrams
     Basic models like TF-IDF
    Vectors, Embeddings
    Clustering 

Using HuggingFace and OpenAI

             Understanding text Sentiment with OpenAI
             Correlation Matrix
             Understanding OpenAI’s embeddings and Models (DaVinci, etc)

Some of the tools we'll be showcasing:
Docker
Jupyter Notebooks
Python
