Measurement and analysis of the geographic distribution of children in poverty allow governments and other organizations to design novel policies to eliminate poverty and monitor the impact of implemented policies. However, child poverty estimations are available only at the country or state level. This work creates a complete and publicly available set of micro-estimates of the distribution of child poverty across nine low- and middle-income countries in West Africa at a 5km2 resolution. 
Estimates of prevalence, severity and specific poverty dimensions such as water, sanitation, housing, and education have been computed using DHS survey data as ground truth and applying Machine Learning models aggregating geographical, demographic, and economic data. Prediction intervals are provided to facilitate responsible downstream use. These methods and maps provide tools to study, guide interventions, monitor and evaluate policies, and track the elimination of child poverty in low and middle-income countries.
