Water, without it life , couldn't continue existing yet in Nuevo Leon, Mexico there has been a lack of this resource. The people and the economy cannot move forward with life without this resource thus new ways should be explored to create a sustainable water management system to preserve this essential resource and make the most with the least amount. Water management depends on data and by using Data Science tools we can think of better strategies and create more options to solve water crisis problems because it allows us to see different perspectives of the problem that might lead to the optimal solution, these tools can help us understand certain patterns in the way that we use the water, how much water should we really be using and understanding the water demand and consumption.
