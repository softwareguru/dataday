Agile processes are common in software engineering but controversial in data science. Agile can keep data scientists happy, focused, and delivering quality work but is often done poorly. 

This talk will cover: 
* Why you should try agile with your data team if you are not already.
* What often goes wrong when data teams try agile.
* How to create the psychologically safe environment that is critical to make agile work.
* Some approaches to agile processes that have worked for teams in academic and industry settings.
