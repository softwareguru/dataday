It’s lonely in your pod, but finally, you receive that long-awaited knock on the port... but can you trust that inbound request? 

This session dives into an essential aspect of a service mesh: trust. We’ll dive into how certificates work into Istio, use peer authentication, and explain concepts like SPIFFE identifiers. Peer thrust can also be leveraged in the application architecture. 

A mesh is not only for cluster administrators but also for architects and developers, making it well worth to highlight those patterns.
