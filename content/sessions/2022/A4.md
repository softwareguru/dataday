Telemetry is message-based automated communication processes from multiple data sources, like applications running on customers’ machines. We consistently use telemetry to improve our security products that run on hundreds of thousands of customer machines, protecting against up to 800 alerts every hour. In this talk, we’ll discuss examples from Elastic Security Protections, including how we keep our machine learning models up to date, identify gaps in product adoption, and develop our product roadmap to take advantage of our telemetry.
