Smart ear-tag for cattle  with tiny ML inside to detect the different types of movement, capable to store them and send the summarized data at the end of day with minimal energy consumption and efficient payload use for LoRa.
The Central ANN algorithm for detecting sick cows is still under testing (GCP TensorFlow ML platform)
The patent registration  was awarded in February 2020 (IMPI Mx/u/2019/000583).
