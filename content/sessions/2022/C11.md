Hugging Face Hub allows you to upload your own machine learning models, create demos, and upload data sets. All this together allows anyone to create a showcase of their ML capabilities that can be shown to potential collaborators or employers. It begins by showing how to download models, then we do transfer learning to generate a new model. The new model is uploaded to the HuggingFace Hub and we create a demo with it using Gradio.
