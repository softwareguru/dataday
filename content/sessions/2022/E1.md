In social networks, users often engage with like-minded peers. This selective exposure to opinions might result in echo chambers, i.e., political fragmentation and social polarization of user interactions. Using an opinion dynamic model, we illustrate how a novel intervention we term random dynamical nudge (RDN) can effectively depolarize online environment and prevent future polarization. We then propose a test of this intervention in a real-life social media platform, with an aim to encouraging dialogue and, ultimately, strengthening democratic deliberation in social media.
