A first commit to Istio.io can be daunting and there is a large amount of learning and commitment required to contribute to Istio.io. By presenting my experiences, I want to encourage both people familiar and unfamiliar to Istio, to contribute. I also hope to give some insight on the PR process for contributing to Istio.io, and show some relatively easy first commit examples. I found a home in the Docs WG, and I hope to help introduce others to this community by helping with their first commit.
