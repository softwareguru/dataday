*This talk is presented by Softtek.*

In the evolving landscape of AI and data, the integration of generative AI models into data-driven applications has become a game-changer. This talk, titled "Using Generative AI to Enhance Data-Driven Applications," will explore the role of generative AI—specifically Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures—in revolutionizing the way applications leverage data for enhanced decision-making and insights.

Jorge Eduardo García Serna, an experienced software engineer specializing in AI and Machine Learning, will provide insights into how generative models can process, analyze, and create data in ways that traditional methods cannot. By delving into practical use cases and real world applications, this talk will showcase how businesses and developers can harness the power of generative AI to improve efficiency, scalability, and overall performance in their data-driven systems.

Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of:
•	The mechanics behind LLMs and RAG architectures.
•	How generative AI enhances data interpretation and decision-making.
•	The integration of these technologies into existing data pipelines.
•	The future potential of generative AI in various sectors, from automation to intelligent decision support systems.

This session is designed for AI enthusiasts, data scientists, and developers seeking to stay at the forefront of AI-driven innovations, offering actionable insights on how to leverage generative AI to transform their data applications.
