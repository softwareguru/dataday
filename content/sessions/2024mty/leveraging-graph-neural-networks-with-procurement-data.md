Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are particularly effective when dealing with non-Euclidean data representations without losing their inherent meaning. In our scenario, we have a network of connections among over 10,000 suppliers and aim to generate accurate recommendations for a new supplier or address inquiries such as, *What is the best alternative supplier to switch to?* and *What are the characteristics and motivations for acquiring a supplier?* We will delve into the theoretical aspects of GNNs and present the findings obtained.
