Istio allows users to enable Envoy access logs. These logs provide extensive information and are one of the first steps in diagnosing networking problems in a service mesh.  Engarde is a tool which parses Istio access logs into easily readable JSON objects.  With Engarde, you get the log field names, but to the average user there are still some knowledge gaps that require a hop over to Envoy's website to understand what is shown in the logs. This extension combines Engarde with Envoy's documentation all in one place.
