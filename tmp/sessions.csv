In this talk, we will cover how Istio can be used in 5G platforms to achieve uniform security and visibility across these CNFs deployed in multiple clusters across different sites including edge. However, rolling out Istio at this scale brings its own challenges around lifecycle management, tenant isolation, identity management and visibility beyond metrics and traces. We will cover the lessons learned and tradeoffs between various architectures, in particular:

Tenancy isolation
5G aware telemetry
Uniform identity between legacy and workloads in the mesh
Deep packet inspection

Attendees will gain insight into how service providers use Istio at a large scale and what the future holds for a mesh everywhere world from backend to edge to devices"

Even in person, one of the best ways to convey problems, solutions, and architecture discussions is through diagramming and white boarding. As one of the authors of Istio in Action for Manning Publishers, I've gone through many refinements of diagrams to help explain Istio.  In this talk, we'll use live diagramming, architecture sketches, demos and no slides, to illustrate how best to get started with Istio and iteratively adopt it into production. We will cover concepts like sidecar injection, the power of gateways, best practices for tying in PKI, and DNS proxying as we slowly add new workloads to a mesh. "

We began to accept that the limitations of our Hub and Spoke API Gateway model would be impossible to patch.  With a significant move to Kubernetes within the company and with Service Mesh technologies on the near horizon, we began the journey to bring Service Mesh to our enterprise.  We quickly discovered that deploying Istio for the enterprise comes with a host of challenges. Supporting multi-region deployments with non-flat networks and securely managing multitenant configuration across hundreds of Kubernetes clusters proved challenging.

C++ and JavaScript developers can write, compile, deploy and test extensions quickly, with just a bit of Istio EnvoyFilter YAML on their clusters.

Yet developers I’ve talked to are not having success getting started.  Others start but get stuck factoring their idea into a framework of HTTP protocol callbacks. Even a good design is not enough—troubleshooting extensions is difficult and some developers give up in frustration.

We created a Definition of Done to determine what it means for releases and features to be considered stable. This has led to release notes tooling, standardized feature maturity levels and release gates. We also created a new Upgrade Workgroup to improve the stability, user experience, and test infrastructure around Istio upgrades. This talk will explore what each of these new additions means for you as a user and whether you can trust that new release or feature in your production environment.

In this topic, we will present how to use ORAS client to push the WASM modules with the allowed media types into ACR registry, and then deploy the WASM filter into all the pods corresponding to the specified workload selection criteria. All the steps in the WASM filter deployment are using a declarative way, meaning that you can create one CRD to describe the WASM filter deployment.
