                      Building the next fastest, secure and reliable 5G platform is challenging in its own right but doing that while modernizing your infrastructure and onboarding Cloud-Native Functions (CNFs) from multiple vendors can be a herculean effort
In this talk, we will cover how Istio can be used in 5G platforms to achieve uniform security and visibility across these CNFs deployed in multiple clusters across different sites including edge. However, rolling out Istio at this scale brings its own challenges around lifecycle management, tenant isolation, identity management and visibility beyond metrics and traces.

                      Virtual conference presentations lack the dynamic and expressive feeling of a live talk in so many dimensions, and explaining complex concepts can be difficult. Even in person, one of the best ways to convey problems, solutions, and architecture discussions is through diagramming and white boarding. As one of the authors of Istio in Action for Manning Publishers, I&rsquo;ve gone through many refinements of diagrams to help explain Istio. In this talk, we&rsquo;ll use live diagramming, architecture sketches, demos and no slides, to illustrate how best to get started with Istio and iteratively adopt it into production.

                      In order to support modern, responsive, real-time experiences across thousands of microservices, at Intuit we needed a solution for high-performance networking at scale. We began to accept that the limitations of our Hub and Spoke API Gateway model would be impossible to patch. With a significant move to Kubernetes within the company and with Service Mesh technologies on the near horizon, we began the journey to bring Service Mesh to our enterprise.

                      As we start to go toward cloud-native infrastructure and build our applications out of microservices, we must fully face the drawbacks and challenges to doing so. One of the most important aspect is securing (authentication and authorization) the services correctly.
In this session, we&rsquo;ll show how Istio can simplify your security model when adopting (micro) services architecture.
We expect most developers haven&rsquo;t adequately solved for these issues, so we&rsquo;ll take it to step by step and build up a strong understanding of Istio and how it is used to secure the service mesh.

                      This talk will be delivered in Chinese and will cover the development of service mesh technology in China, and the use of Istio in the Chinese industry. I’ll discuss the growth of the community, and introduce ‘ServiceMesher’ &ndash; the service mesh community group in China. This talk will also cover how to get involved in the Istio community, and what study materials are available to people who want to join. As Istio becomes more popular and widely used, this talk will highlight the ways that the Chinese community has contributed to the growth of service mesh, and how we’re all continuing to learn and grow as users, what resources we have to support our knowledge.

                      Spring Cloud has been widely used as a micro service framework in the past several years, especially in traditional enterprise cases. Istio, as a leading service mesh solution, is gaining great popularity, and widely used in cloud-native applications. Istio help customer build a highly resilient, secure, observable and scalable microservice architecture by offloading the complexity from application code to a separate infrastructure layer.
In this presentation, inspired by several typical customers’ cloud native solutions, Chaomeng will share a topic of best practice of Spring Cloud and Istio.

                      Original source address is heavily relied on by many scenarios, however in service mesh, with sidecar injected and traffic proxied by a sidecar, it is naturally unable to get the original client ip address.
In this presentation, Zhonghu will introduce what istio and envoy have done to help preserve original source ip both for TCP and HTTP protocols. And then he will present a live demo about how to achieve original src IP preserve with proxy protocol, original source filter, and TProxy.

                      Istio is the default networking layer solution of Knative and it is leveraged for routing, traffic splitting, security and so on. We&rsquo;re now building a large-scale, multi-tenant serverless platform on top of Knative and Istio. While building it, one of the main questions was how to tune Istio together with Knative so it can unleash the maximum scalability and performance.
In this session, we will share how we detected performance bottlenecks using difficult but fruitful analysis processes, tuned and optimized Istio and our platform, and eventually reduced over 90% latency in Knative service provision scenario.

                      Atlassian has been deploying Envoy to the compute nodes of its internal PaaS over the past 2 years to simplify service-to-service communication for internal developers. Today we deploy Envoy with static configuration and we want to take advantage of dynamic features like client-side routing, direct communication, and fault injection. We decided Istio was the best choice to deliver this over the next year. We’ll talk through Atlassian’s journey with service-to-service communication, Envoy and the evolution of our home-grown control planes, then walk through the analysis that led to Istio being the best decision for Atlassian’s business moving forward.

In this talk, we dig into T-Mobile’s journey of adopting Istio across 100+ clusters to support microservices for fraud detection, billing, sales and APIs across many teams. The journey was not all rainbows and unicorns.

The presentation will be mainly driven by demos. The first demo will be based on simply starting multiple KinD clusters locally, and get Istio offerings in action.

Istio has offered extensibility through WebAssembly since 1.5. User code, running in the sidecar, can implement custom traffic management and telemetry. No Istio control plane access or special builds of the sidecar are needed. C++ and JavaScript developers can write, compile, deploy and test extensions quickly, with just a bit of Istio EnvoyFilter YAML on their clusters.

To solve that problem we abstracted Istio completely inside a generic Helm chart for common use cases. For more complex cases create a MutatingWebhook in k8s that reads annotations from the deployments and configures the deployment to support all Istio related logic.

One day we had big trouble due to a node failure, and it was very hard to find the root cause about why our application had not been recovered automatically. At that time, we finally found the root cause of it on our application logic thanks to Istio and we could reproduce the same failure on development environment with Istio as well.

Helm lets us build a simplified facade over Istio, allowing developers to more naturally express their intentions as code instead of forcing them to think in Istio CRDs.
In this session we will look at four common Istio configuration patterns, and explore how Helm dramatically simplifies their use.

                      It’s lonely in your pod, but finally, you receive that long-awaited knock on the port&hellip; but can you trust that inbound request?
This session dives into an essential aspect of a service mesh: trust. We’ll dive into how certificates work into Istio, use peer authentication, and explain concepts like SPIFFE identifiers. Peer thrust can also be leveraged in the application architecture.
A mesh is not only for cluster administrators but also for architects and developers, making it well worth to highlight those patterns.

                      One of the primary benefits of using Istio is its comprehensive security model, which enables users to express complex authentication and authorization policies for the services running within their mesh. While these security features are commonly used, they can cause confusion and are frequently misunderstood.
This talk will explore the security mechanisms available in Istio and will dive into how these policies are translated from high-level user-facing configuration to runtime policies in the various Envoy proxies that comprise the Istio data plane.

                      Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great to have an easy way to dynamically, via istio, limit the traffic to a service in Kubernetes?
Figure out you have one or more ingress gateways for the incoming requests, and you want to limit the requests from a single IP, or to limit requests with an specific http header in an specific amount of time.
With this operator you just have to create and deploy a simple Custom Resource (CR) with your desired rate limit configuration.

In 2020, we collected feedback and used it to focus on producing higher quality and more consistent releases. We created a Definition of Done to determine what it means for releases and features to be considered stable. This has led to release notes tooling, standardized feature maturity levels and release gates.

However, both academic and industry surveys show that massive organizations and users are still deploying their workloads in VMs to fulfill their needs like security, multi-tenancy, fitting into the existing processes and hybrid multi-clouds. To include those workloads outside of K8s, Istio has introduced VM support since 1.6.

                      With the introduction of WebAssembly (for short,WASM) support, you can extend the data plane&rsquo;s functionality by writing custom Filters for out-of-process Envoy proxy in service mesh. But it&rsquo;s not easy to build, deploy and run WASM filters within service mesh. ORAS is a proposed implementation for the OCI Artifacts project, which aims to extend the OCI registry specification and simplify storing arbitrary content in OCI registries.
In this topic, we will present how to use ORAS client to push the WASM modules with the allowed media types into ACR registry, and then deploy the WASM filter into all the pods corresponding to the specified workload selection criteria.

eBPF is a revolutionary technology that can run sandboxed programs in the Linux kernel without changing kernel source code or loading kernel modules.Replacing iptables with ebpf allows data traverse from Envoy‘s inbound socket to its outbound socket directly,reducing datapath over loopback interface and sparing iptable rules.

                      Traffic management is probably the most used feature of Istio. However, handling layer-7 traffic other than HTTP and gRPC can become challenging in an Istio service mesh. In this session, I&rsquo;ll discuss a few possible approaches to extend Istio&rsquo;s traffic management capability to other layer-7 protocols such as Dubbo, Thrift, TARS, Redis, MySql, MongoDB, etc. I&rsquo;ll introduce Aeraki, an open-source project that provides a framework to allow Istio to support more layer 7 protocols than just HTTP and gRPC.

                      Istio has some basic tooling to facilitate request troubleshooting, but it has something much more powerful at its core: Envoy proxy. When requests in the mesh start failing, Envoy is the definitive source for debugging information as it has a wealth of telemetry and logging that can be enabled to pinpoint problems along the request path. Trouble with certificates? Incorrect headers? Connection pooling or upstream errors? Un-routable request?
In this talk, we’ll look at how to build a repeatable and automatable set of tools to quickly debug a request path across multiple hops and potentially across multiple clusters and Istio control planes.

                      As service mesh gains wider adoption, more and more companies are looking to bring Istio to their organization. Istio will impact many teams, from operations to developers, and it&rsquo;s important that they are well equipped. First you’ll hear a success story from the Square Cash team, who decided to move to Istio from Square’s homegrown Envoy service mesh. They’ll discuss why it was the right move for them, how they executed the move, and what they’d do differently if they were to do it a second time.

In 2020, there were over 11 security bulletins released that spanned from Istio 1.3 to Istio 1.8. In this talk, we will explain why the group was created, how it operates, and its mission to make Istio more secure.
Namely, we will discuss:
 A brief history of how the group was formed Why it was necessary for the group to be created A look at Istio security vulnerabilities in 2020 How we triage security reports and fix them Pro-active measures the group is working on to make Istio more secure  Please join us to learn about the responsibilities of the Product Security Working Group and how to stay informed about the security of your environments.

But if you go for a completely separate tool for API Gateway requirements and for other stuff use Istio, then you effectively have to maintain two different tool and build the expertise in your team for two different disciplines. But Istio can take care of almost all your API Gateway requirements(except for a few).

                      So you&rsquo;ve actually done security well and are using an external Redis provider that only allows TLS to talk to it. You could simply configure each of your applications to use TLS from the application pod or you can use Istio to handle the TLS part. This lightning talk demonstrates how to use Istio to do TLS origination for Redis (TCP) using the sidecar instead of the egress gateway.

                      Microservices applications rely on complex interactions among services. Engineering teams must create API tests with API mocks to shift testing left. Current approaches to mock creation are manual, which is expensive and inefficient.
We illustrate how Istio can be leveraged to significantly reduce engineering effort necessary for API testing.
API tests can be built using the following Istio capabilities:
 Dynamic deployment of Envoy filters to capture relevant examples of API requests and responses.

                      I will talk about the better external authorization feature in 1.9 that allows users to easily integrate Istio with external authorization system (e.g. OPA, OAuth2).
The better external authorization is the latest improvement that solves a much wanted customer request for better extensibility in the authorization policy.
This feature makes it possible and greatly improves the user experience of many critical use cases, for example, integrate with industry standard auth mechanism (e.

                      This talk will walk through canary deployments process and how to achieve the same using Kubernetes service orchestration or Spring Cloud Gateway focusing on the limitations of these approaches and how Istio overcomes these limitations. Spring cloud Gateway or Kubernetes LoadBalancer service or Ingress controllers only supports the edge service routing and not Internal routing from edge service to another service in cluster. This is where Istio virtual services and destination rules come to rescue – this talk with elaborate further on how Istio provides an optimal solution for canary releases in this scenario.

                      Istio allows users to enable Envoy access logs. These logs provide extensive information and are one of the first steps in diagnosing networking problems in a service mesh. Engarde is a tool which parses Istio access logs into easily readable JSON objects. With Engarde, you get the log field names, but to the average user there are still some knowledge gaps that require a hop over to Envoy&rsquo;s website to understand what is shown in the logs.

                      Istio’s Virtual Service API provides a language agnostic way of implementing graceful retries on failures until a timeout budget is exhausted. Precise timeouts and retries per endpoint result in better performance. Having hundreds of gRPC services means there will be as many YAML files to be configured, tested and managed, however. I will explain how we built a scalable way of managing retries and timeouts across the service mesh per service per RPC.
