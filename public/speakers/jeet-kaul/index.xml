      <description>FICO started it&amp;rsquo;s mesh journey in 2019, picking up Istio at 0.8. It&amp;rsquo;s been a bumpy road! Istio has matured a lot in that time, and the organization&amp;rsquo;s deployment and usage of Istio has matured significantly too. Jeet, a VP of Engineering at FICO, will walk through FICO&amp;rsquo;s journey with Istio from 2019 to today, discussing why they chose Istio initially, some of the growing pains they experienced, and what business goals they&amp;rsquo;ve been able to achieve because of Istio.</description>
