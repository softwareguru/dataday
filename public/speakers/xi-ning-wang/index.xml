      <description>With the introduction of WebAssembly (for short,WASM) support, you can extend the data plane&amp;rsquo;s functionality by writing custom Filters for out-of-process Envoy proxy in service mesh. But it&amp;rsquo;s not easy to build, deploy and run WASM filters within service mesh. ORAS is a proposed implementation for the OCI Artifacts project, which aims to extend the OCI registry specification and simplify storing arbitrary content in OCI registries.
In this topic, we will present how to use ORAS client to push the WASM modules with the allowed media types into ACR registry, and then deploy the WASM filter into all the pods corresponding to the specified workload selection criteria.</description>
