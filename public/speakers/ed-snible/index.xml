      <description>This talk is for every engineer interested in creating traffic management and telemetry capabilities for the mesh itself.
Istio has offered extensibility through WebAssembly since 1.5. User code, running in the sidecar, can implement custom traffic management and telemetry. No Istio control plane access or special builds of the sidecar are needed. C++ and JavaScript developers can write, compile, deploy and test extensions quickly, with just a bit of Istio EnvoyFilter YAML on their clusters.</description>
