      <description>We introduced Istio on our microservices. Istioâ€™s logs, metrics and features are very helpful for us to investigate in detail in case of failures.
One day we had big trouble due to a node failure, and it was very hard to find the root cause about why our application had not been recovered automatically. At that time, we finally found the root cause of it on our application logic thanks to Istio and we could reproduce the same failure on development environment with Istio as well.</description>
