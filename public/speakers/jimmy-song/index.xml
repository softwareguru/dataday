      <description>This talk will be delivered in Chinese and will cover the development of service mesh technology in China, and the use of Istio in the Chinese industry. I’ll discuss the growth of the community, and introduce ‘ServiceMesher’ &amp;ndash; the service mesh community group in China. This talk will also cover how to get involved in the Istio community, and what study materials are available to people who want to join. As Istio becomes more popular and widely used, this talk will highlight the ways that the Chinese community has contributed to the growth of service mesh, and how we’re all continuing to learn and grow as users, what resources we have to support our knowledge.</description>
