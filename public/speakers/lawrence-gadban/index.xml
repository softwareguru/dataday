      <description>One of the primary benefits of using Istio is its comprehensive security model, which enables users to express complex authentication and authorization policies for the services running within their mesh. While these security features are commonly used, they can cause confusion and are frequently misunderstood.
This talk will explore the security mechanisms available in Istio and will dive into how these policies are translated from high-level user-facing configuration to runtime policies in the various Envoy proxies that comprise the Istio data plane.</description>
