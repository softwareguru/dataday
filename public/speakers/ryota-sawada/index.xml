      <description>Istio documentation covers many scenarios how you can start up Istio and get your hands dirty with its offerings. Things become a bit more tricky when it involves multiple clusters, and even more complicated when there are other Open Source projects you need to deal with.
The presentation will be mainly driven by demos. The first demo will be based on simply starting multiple KinD clusters locally, and get Istio offerings in action.</description>
